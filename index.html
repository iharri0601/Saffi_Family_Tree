  <h1> Saffi's family</h1>
  <p> I never knew Saffi's true origin just like Jimmy Two-shoes and Helouse, so I made up a family tree with different characters.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Boros was the father of Saffi after he met her mother, Xena the warrior princess.</li>
    <li>Boros met Xena on a distant planet far from Earth.</li>
    <li>They both battle with each other and the result was a draw. They later fell in love and ended the war.</li>
    <li>Saffi was born on the Xena's homeworld later on. Xena later finds out that Boros would use her daughter as a weapon of Mass destruction. So she send Saffi away to miseryville before being killed by Boros' hand. Saff grew up as a scavanger eating out of trashcans until she met Jimmy Two-Shoes and Beezy.</li>
  </ul>

<div class="kenshiro-family">
  <h2>Kenshiro and Athena</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Athena was the goddess of wisdom who was fighting the lord of the underworld, Hades.</li>
    <li>Kenshiro was a fighter who was found a post  </li>
    <li>After Kenshiro defeated his brother Raoh, he was encounterd by Athen the leader of the saint seiyas. </li>
    <li>Hades of the underworld started to unleash havoc upon the world, and Kenshiro and Athen along with the other saint seiyas have banded together to defeat this evil.</li>
    <li>After the defeat of Hades, Kenshiro started a family with Athena by creating three children: Sayaka, Sauron, and Xena.</li>
    <li>The Golden Pegasus got jealous of Kenshiro and Athena, and tried to kill them in anger, but failed.</li>

  <h1> Saffi's family</h1>
  <p> I never knew Saffi's true origin just like Jimmy Two-shoe and Helouse, so I made up a family tree with different characters.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Boros was the father of Saffi after he met her mother, Xena the warrior princess.</li>
    <li>Boros met Xena on a distant planet far from Earth.</li>
    <li>They both battle with each other and the result was a draw. They later fell in love and ended the war.</li>
    <li>Saffi was born on the Xena's homeworld later on. Xena later finds out that Boros would use her daughter as a weapon of Mass destruction. She send Saffi away to miseryville before died by Boros' hand. Saff grew up as a scavanger eating out of trashcans until she met Jimmy Two-Shoes and Beezy.</li>
